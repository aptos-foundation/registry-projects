### Overview

Sports betting is a popular form of entertainment and speculation worldwide, yet it faces several challenges that can undermine trust and limit accessibility.

- The lack of transparency in traditional sports betting systems is a significant concern, as bettors often struggle to verify the integrity of the odds calculation and payout processes.
- The centralized nature of sportsbooks makes them vulnerable to potential fraud and manipulation by insiders, as well as risks associated with frozen payouts in certain jurisdictions.

By integrating Aptos, sports betting platforms can offer a scalable, transparent, and immutable record of all transactions, allowing users to verify the integrity of the system and its brand.

There is a significant opportunity to utilize crypto primitives such as randomness, collateralization, and on-chain yield generation for liquidity providers (LPs).
